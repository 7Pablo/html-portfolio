<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    The music in this movie is spectacular, the cinematography
    It's great, and the great performance of the cast makes this sy-fy movie
     a visual delight.

<h3>Spider Into the Spiderverse y Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>
    The best animated movies in history with one of the
    best soundtracks out there. It has a lot of emotion, action,
    and a color palette that goes hand in hand directly with the
    characters' emotions. Just perfect movies.
